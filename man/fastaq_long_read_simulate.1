.SH NAME
fastaq_long_read_simulate
.SH DESCTION
fastaq_long_read_simulate [options] <infile> <outfile>
.PP
Simulates long reads from a fasta/q file. Can optionally make insertions into
the reads, like pacbio does. If insertions made, coverage calculation is done
before the insertions (so total read length may appear longer then expected).
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
infile
Name of input fasta/q file
.TP
outfile
Name of output fasta file
.SS "optional arguments:"

.TP
fB--methodfR tiling|uniform|gamma
How to sample the read positions and lengths. Choose
from 1) "tiling", where reads of fixed length are
taken at equal intervals from the reference. 2)
"unfiform", where reads of fixed length taken at
positions sampled uniformly. 3) "gamma", where reads
lengths are taken from a gamma distribution, and
positions sampled uniformly. [tiling]
.TP
fB--seedfR INT
Seed for random number generator [default: use
python's default]
.TP
fB--qualfR INT
Write a file of fake quality scores called
outfile.qual, all bases same quality [None]
.TP
fB--fixed_read_lengthfR INT
Length of each read. Only applies if method is tile or
uniform. [20000]
.TP
fB--coveragefR FLOAT
Read coverage. Only applies if method is gamma or
uniform. [2]
.SS "tiling options:"
.TP
fB--tile_stepfR INT
Distance between start of each read [10000]
.SS "gamma options:"
.TP
fB--gamma_shapefR FLOAT
Shape parameter of gamma distribution [1.2]
.TP
fB--gamma_scalefR FLOAT
Scale parameter of gamma distribution [6000]
.TP
fB--gamma_min_lengthfR INT
Minimum read length [20000]
.SS "options to add insertions to reads:"
.TP
fB--ins_skipfR INT
Insert a random base every fB--skipfR bases plus or minus
fB--ins_windowfR. If this option is used, must also use
fB--ins_windowfR.
.TP
fB--ins_windowfR INT
See fB--ins_skipfR. If this option is used, must also use
fB--ins_skipfR.
